1. Go to https://www.pulumi.com/ and either sign up or sign in if you already have a Pulumi account. Pulumi is free for individual use, so you can sign up without any charge. You have a few options to use to sign up. In my case, I signed up through my GitHub.
2. Once you're signed up, go to Projects and click the *+ Create project* button. 
3. Choose the cloud and programming language. In my case, I'll go with AWS and Python.
4. Give the project a name, description, choose a stack name, and specify the AWS region.
5. Click *Create project*
6. Follow the instructions on the getting *Get started* page for your operating system.
